# Fisher analysis for constraining dark matter+baryon interaction in early universe. 

The purpose for this repo is to constrain cosmolocial parameters the CMB simulated in the Boltzman code CLASS. In particular I have been constraining the 6 LCDM parameters in addition the the early-universe dark matter-baryon scattering cross section using a modified version of CLASS. 

<b>compute_fisher_dmb</b> computes the fisher matrix for a given experiment with required input of dark matter (DM) mass, velocity dependence, and relagtive bulk velocity which uses simulated cosmological observables from CLASS.
