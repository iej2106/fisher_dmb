# Fisher analysis for constraining dark matter+baryon interaction in early universe. 


The files named *compute_fisher_dmb* computes the fisher matrix for a given experiment with required input of dark matter (DM) mass and velocity dependence, which uses simulated cosmological observables from CLASS.

Each experiment has their own sets of noise curves:
